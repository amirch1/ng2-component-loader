# Angular 2 Component Loader

The component loader is an attribute  directive that can be used for any component to allow displaying a loading message during data load. While the message is being diaplayed, the component UI is blocked for user interaction. The loading message itself can be customize using an exposed directive property.

## Demo

You can see the [running demo here](https://amirch1.github.io/ng2-component-loader/).
Timeout is used to simulate data loading calls.
