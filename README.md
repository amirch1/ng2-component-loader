# Angular 2 Component Loader

The component loader is an attribute  directive that can be attached to any component allowing the display of a loading message during data loading. While the message is being diaplayed, the component UI is blocked from user interaction. The loading message itself can be customized using an exposed directive property.

## Demo

You can see the [running demo here](https://amirch1.github.io/ng2-component-loader/).
A timeout is used to simulate data loading calls.
